Hello, my name is Dominika. :wave:\
\
I chose this project to learn the secrets of manual testing through practice. I want to start working in the IT field, because I have always liked new technologies, creative, unconventional thinking and problem solving.
I would like to create a suitable portfolio to start a new career path. I hope, this challenge will help me with that!\
Sooo...Welcome and follow my work. :point_down:

### Interface evaluation
The application interface is simple, but does not attract the user's attention. The advantage is the responsiveness of the website.

### Intuitiveness

### Is everything OK?

* inability to create a new User
* when you click 'remind password',then leave the field 'email' empty or enter an incorrect email format and click the 'send' button, the message 'message sent successfully' appears
